# 10 Minute Energy

This mod changes the drinks from the vending machine with a duration so that their timers will stack if you drink multiple. Now you can drink a dozen Speed Slurpos to have an hour of uninterrupted speed.

If you drink different incompatible drinks (eg, Catcher's Cola, followed by Catcher's Cola ULTRA), then the effects and duration will still be overwritten by the new soda.
